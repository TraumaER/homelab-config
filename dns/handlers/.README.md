# Caddy Handlers Directory

This directory contains Caddy handler files that are automatically imported into the main Caddyfile. Place your custom
handler configurations here to be included in the server configuration.

## Usage

Create `.caddy` files in this directory with your handler configurations. These files will be automatically imported
into the main Caddyfile using the `import` directive.

## Example

Example handler file (`app.caddy`):

Example contents
```
@foo host foo.{$INTERNAL_DOMAIN}
handle @foo {
  reverse_proxy 192.168.0.100:9003
}
```
